TEXT{
This is my online repository of pdfs of books. Reading is important! 

This is also my refresher to web development (pre-server side). Hopefully I can dig out a little niche on this here internet. I will build a laboratory of sorts to house my work.
It will serve as an easily accessible shelf for myself. Instead of surfing the web, which I truly think has gone the way of the dinosaur. Wit 'improved' search methods, self-discovery is 
quickly becoming introspection. Therefore I am building a bastion against that. It will house assistant with reasoning capabilities, but those agents will work as curators of the library. Hopefully with enough of them, they can start providing suggestions between themselves. I haven't outlined this more formally, but it should involve some sort of optimization with inherent 'random-ness' from the digital environment. Mostly I would like my news, correspondence sorted within a single framework.

Enough for now. There is a website to build!


addendum: Perhaps a way to personalize this experience? After I build one version of this I should make everyone have a dashboard available? Maybe some sort of drag and drop interface that overlays on a webbrowers? Or even has a webbrowser in it?
